description: Unit and Integration Tests: Write tests that cover all critical pathways, including tenant isolation, role-based access, and data flows. End-to-end tests can simulate a complete booking flow, ensuring that changes in one module reflect correctly across the system. 	â€¢	Automated CI/CD: Use continuous integration tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run your tests on every commit. This helps catch inconsistencies or integration issues early.
