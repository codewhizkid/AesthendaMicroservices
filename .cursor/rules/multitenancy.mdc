# 	•	Tenant Isolation:
	•	Every data model (users, appointments, resources, etc.) should have a tenantId field.
	•	Enforce tenant filtering in every query and mutation via middleware or within resolvers.
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
	•	Define granular roles and permissions for each tenant (e.g., salon_admin, stylist, front_desk).
	•	Make sure each service validates not only user identity but also that actions are permitted within the tenant’s context.
