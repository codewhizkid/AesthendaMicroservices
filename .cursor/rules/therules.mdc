# Building a full-stack SaaS like Aesthenda requires careful planning and adherence to the following fundamental rules:
	•	Modular, Scalable Architecture:
Use a microservices approach with a unified API gateway.
	•	Robust Multi-Tenancy & RBAC:
Enforce data isolation and role-based permissions through all layers (data model, resolvers, middleware).
	•	Centralized, Consistent Configuration and Error Handling:
Ensure that configuration, logging, and error management are handled in one place.
	•	Strong Security Practices:
Implement JWT, OAuth, encryption, audit logging, and monitoring to keep the system secure.
	•	Automated Testing and CI/CD:
Build thorough tests and maintain automated pipelines to ensure quality and consistency in deployments.
	•	Responsive User Experience:
Integrate a flexible, real-time front end that adapts to user roles and tenant-specific branding.
