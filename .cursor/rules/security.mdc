# Security
	•	Authentication & Authorization:
	•	Use robust token-based authentication (JWT) with built-in support for token refresh and social logins (OAuth with Google, Facebook).
	•	Enforce strict role-based authorization at the API and service layer.
	•	Data Protection:
	•	Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
	•	Use HTTPS for all communications.
	•	Connection & Dependency Management:
	•	Use a centralized configuration system for environment variables and secrets.
	•	Enforce strict dependency versioning and avoid duplicate or multiple active connections (as with Mongoose).
	•	Audit Logging & Monitoring:
	•	Implement audit logs to track key actions (changes to tenant settings, role assignments, etc.).
	•	Regularly monitor logs and set up alerting on anomalies.
