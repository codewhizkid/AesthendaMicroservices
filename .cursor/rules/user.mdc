# Responsive, Consistent UI:
	•	Build the front end using consistent design guidelines (e.g., Tailwind CSS) and centralized state management (e.g., React Context or Redux).
	•	Ensure that the UI adapts based on user roles (e.g., a unified dashboard with conditional rendering for admin, stylist, and client views).
	•	Real-Time Updates:
	•	Integrate GraphQL subscriptions or WebSockets to provide real-time UI updates that reflect back-end changes immediately (critical for booking systems).
	•	Branding and Customization:
	•	Allow tenants to customize client-facing pages (white-label options), ensuring that their branding appears consistently across the platform.
